## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript


### What I learned

I will regard this project as my first herculean one-paged project. There was lot of stress sitting down and coding. This project has made me confident knowing that I can resize a web page to fit different screen sizes. Also, I used some JS event listeners which I never thought. I had to think outside the box but mind you, my logic on the functions I wrote shows my be beginner level in JS.
Most importantly, I have come to the realiztion that "what one div cannot do, more divs would do it."

### Continued development

If You go through my JS script file, one can easily say I need to continue learning more on JS. More projects would help me 

### Useful resources

A lot of resources was helpful not just in this project but from the beginning of my learning of web development.

- And lots more. Surely, I will always recommend them days in and days out
